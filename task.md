VERSION CONTROL
Explaining version control requires a prior knowledge of what a version is. 

Version is a particular form of something being different from its earlier  forms or being slightly higher than previous forms of the same item. 

Brands that have different logos or designs change overtime, and each change is some what better then the other, they often tend to forget and relieve the rights to the old version of their design to work for them, whereas, the same design could actully work for another brand.

This brimgs us to version control

Version control is a stystem that records different versions of a file or set of files and allows you to recall specific versions later on. A version control system comes with tools and guidelines on how you can access your previous versions and how to store them.

GIT
Let me start with defining git as an open souce Version Control System.
This simply means that GIT is a content tracker, or a content saver. 
As a version control system, the content (code) stored in GIT, keeps changing as more changes are added. This means that you are able to see the history of the changes you have made and when you made them. It helps you control different versions of your files.


GIT-HUB

GITHUB is a web based repository that supports version control with  git.
 Being able to save data in the cloud, such as images or mails, github helps you store code based data instead and in turn refers you to other versions of your file as you update changes. It also helps others work on a project together. GitHub is built for developers.


STEP BY STEP GUIDE ON HOW TO CREATE A GITHUB ACCOUNT
Like every other online platform that requires users to become members, you can also create a github account to be able to use it.
Below are the steps on how to make that happen.

1. Go to github.com and view the requirements stated there. You would see a default form to enter your details.
It requires you to enter a username you would like to use. Note that many users are on Github and as such someonelse could already be using the name you want to choose. Make it unique and be sure that no one has it.
Next, enter your email address (it must be valid) as well  as a password that is at least, 8 characters with a number or 15 characters including number and a lowercase letter.

2. Click on SIGN UP and go ahead to verify your account. Which could come in puzzles or simple questions to priove youre human.
Github has made almost all their resources free to use, so you dont have to worry about choosing a free or paid plan.

3. Next is a brief surver about yourself, to help them tailor your interest according to your prefrences. The survery can be taken immediately or later on.

4. Voila!! Welcome to Github. You can make changes to your profile anytime. Github also offers guidelines on how to use the platform. Cheers!!
