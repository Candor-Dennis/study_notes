## Color Theory
``Color`` is a visual attribute of things that results from the light they emit, transmit or reflect. __*Basically, it is the appearance of objects*__ described in terms of intensity and brightness.

``Color theory`` is a term __*used to describe the collection of rules and guidelines regarding the use of color*__ in art and design, as developed since their early days. Color theory informs the design of color schemes, aiming at aesthetic appeal and the effective communication of a design message on both the visual level and the psychological level.

### Categories of color
Color theory is based on color wheel which displays the three categories of color. They are;<br>
- **Primary Colors (Red, Yellow, Blue):** are the root of every other color.
- **Secondary Colors (Orange, Green, Violent):** are a mixture of two primary colors.  
- **Tertiary Colors:** are a mixture of one primary colors with one of its nearest secondary colors e.g. Red-Orange, Yellow-Orange, Yellow-Green, Blue-Green, Blue-Violet and Red-Violet.

### Terminologies in Color Theories
- **Hue:** It is the most basic of color terms and denotes an object’s color. When we say “blue,” “green,” or “red,” we’re talking about hue.<br>
- **Chroma:** It is the purity of a color.<br>
- **Saturation:** It is the intensity of a color. It refers to how a hue appears under particular lighting conditions. i.e. how strong or weak a color is (high saturation being strong and vice-versa).<br>
- **Value:** Refers to how bright or dark a color is. Lighter colors have higher values, black has the lowest value of any hue, and white the highest. Tint, shade and tone make up the value of a color.<br>
- **Tint:** Is formed when white is added to a hue, lightening it.<br>
- **Shade:** Is created when black is added to a hue, making it darker.<br>
- **Tone:** Is created when gray is added to a hue. They are generally duller or softer-looking than pure hues.<br>
- **Colour Groups/Schemes:** It is an arrangement or combination of colors. Colors can be combined to form one of the main color schemes that allow designers to achieve harmony in their designs. These are:<br>
- **Mono Chrome (one color):** They are one type of color scheme separated by lightness in a color scheme. Best for single subjects.<br>
- **Analog (adjacent color):** They are three grouped  colors next to each other in a color scheme. Easy on the eyes, peaceful, comfortable mood, seen in nature.<br>
- **Complementary (opposing color):** They are colors opposite to each other in the color wheel. Naturally pleasing to the eye.<br>
- **Triadic (equally color):** They are colors that sit at a triangle point away from each other.<br>

### Color Temperature
Colors when used correctly can guide the viewer's eyes to what's important and to tell a story. On the other hand, when used incorrectly, can make a viewer feel lost irritated. Basically, colors can make or break a scene.
Colors can be classified into;<br>
- **Warm:**  include red, orange, and yellow, and variations of those three colors. They appear closer to the observer and are used in designs to reflect passion, happiness, enthusiasm, and energy.<br>
- **Cool:** include green, blue, and purple, and variations of those three colors. They are often more subdued than warm colors. Also, they appear farther from the observer and are used in designs to give a sense of calm or professionalism.<br>
