### Elements of Design
Elements of design are like bones and joints that make up the skeletal part of animals. In design, they are the structure of the work, the combination of two or more elements result in a design. 
They general elements of design include;<br>

**Point:** The smallest and simplest of all design elements that can form patterns or delineated space.<br>
**Lines:** Continuous points joined together used to create visible shapes, enclosed areas or demarcations and mostly used to convey moods in user interface designs.<br>
**Texture:** The surface roughness or smoothness of a design element. It is the surface quality (simulated and/or actual) that can be seen and felt.<br>
**Shape:** The area that is contained within an implied line and it has two dimensions: height and width.<br> 
**Colors:** Colors are used to generate emotions, define hierarchy, create interest.<br>
**Value:** Is defined as the relative lightness or darkness, which suggests the depth or volume of a particular object or area.<br>
**Form:** The combination of shape, line and dot. It is the 3D aspect of an object that takes up space.<br>
**Space:** The area between and around objects (negative space) but it also refers to variations in the perspective and proportions of objects, lines or shapes.<br><br>
*During the creation process, these components are used collectively and guided by the design principles.*<br>
### Fundamental Principles of Design
Principles of design guide the use of design elements in the creative process. The principles of design combine the elements to create a composition. In web/app specific design, they are used to improve or enhance the user experience and are made up of the following:<br>
**Balance:** The concept of visual equilibrium of similar, opposing, or contrasting elements that together create a unified whole.<br>
**Emphasis:** Also referred as the focal point, marks the location of design in a composition which strongly draw the viewer's attention, it is also referred as the focal point.<br> 
**Movement:** Is the visual flow through the composition, where (depending on the elements placement) the designer can direct the viewer's eye over the surface of the design.<br>
**Pattern:** An object or symbol that repeats in the design is a pattern.<br> 
**Repetition:** Creates unity and consistency in the composition; it is the reuse of the same, similar or different objects throughout the design.<br>
**Proportion:** The comparative relationship in between two or more elements in a composition with respect to size, color, quantity, degree, etc, or between a whole object and one of its parts.<br> 
**Rhythm:** The alternation or repetition of elements with defined intervals between them, it creates a sense of movement and it is used to establish a pattern and/or texture.<br>
**Unity:** It is used to describe the relationship between the individual elements and the whole of a composition (which creates a sense of completeness, that all of the parts belong together).<br><br>
### Why Is It Important To Understand The Elements And Principles Of Design?
It is possible to create a good design without a thorough understanding of the elements and principles of design. However, this involves a lot of trial and error in order to create something that actually looks good. The following are the reasons why a web/app specific designer must understand the elements and principles of design;<br>
* Designers could save a lot of time and energy by practicing the design principles.
* Good implementation of elements and principles of design help users to focus on their own goals.
* Organization reduces cognitive load i.e. users are not left alone to figure things out.
* Implementation of design principles could help provide direction and guidance to users for getting up to speed.
* In summary, understanding the principles of design keep users in control.
